The Soccer Quiz tests your soccer knowledge across four categories: the 2022 World Cup, Guess the Player, Soccer Clubs, and Soccer Records. Each category has 25 multiple-choice questions. To start, log in using the provided credentials (username: soccerfan, password: worldcup2022). After logging in, you can choose a category, answer questions, and track your progress. At the end, youâ€™ll see a summary of your score, including correct answers, incorrect answers, and your percentage score. The quiz is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling quiz logic and scoring. Future improvements could include more questions, a timer, and user registration. 
The quiz uses forms to collect user input for both login and quiz answers. JavaScript handles most of the logic, such as displaying questions, checking answers, and keeping score. Visual feedback is provided: correct answers turn green, while incorrect ones turn red, making it easy to see how you did. The quiz starts with a simple "fake" login, where correct credentials let you begin the quiz. It immediately shows if an answer is right or wrong and includes a progress counter, so users can track how far they are into the quiz.
